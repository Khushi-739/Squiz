					 Power Is Impossible Not To Love
				 </div>	
<div class="xx">
With her bombastic personality and iconic design, complete with small horns and fangs, Denji's partner Power quickly became the manga's most beloved character.
Despite regularly proclaiming her low opinion of humans, Power slowly learns to love Denji and Aki like a family -- even if she isn't the easiest roommate to live with. Watching her character development is one of the best parts of the entire manga, her death is a shocking and incredibly sad moment, and her sacrifice to save Denji is one of the series' most moving scenes so far.

					 Makima Is One Of Shonen Manga's Best Villains
				 </div>	
<div class="xx1">
Initially appearing as the leader of the Public Safety Devil Hunters, apparently a force for good, there immediately seems something creepy about Makima and her treatment of her underlings.

					 Aki Is A Fascinating Take On A Shonen Rival
				 </div>	
<div class="xx2">
Denji's fellow devil hunter, Aki, embodies many of the standard elements of a shonen protagonist's rival. He's far more serious and reserved than Denji, with the two initially having a combative relationship, and his motivation is revenge for what he suffered during his tragic backstory.

Chainsaw Man brilliantly deconstructs this archetype. Aki's self-sacrificial attitude has emotionally devastating effects on his friends, and his campaign against the Gun Devil is ultimately pointless, as his transformation into the Gun Fiend means that he ends up literally becoming what he hated the most.

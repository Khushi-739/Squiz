   Despite the recent reveal trailer from "Chainsaw Man's" animators, studio MAPPA, we actually don't know when the anime is set to be released. Production appears to be rolling along smoothly, as MAPPA's work looks polished and expressive enough to live up to its illustrious reputation (it's also responsible for "Jujutsu Kaisen" and the final season of "Attack on Titan). However, there is no way of telling when "Chainsaw Man" will be released with certainty until the show's creators say otherwise.
<br>
   That being said, we can still extrapolate a rough idea of when "Chainsaw Man" might release based on MAPPA's other shows. For instance, "Jujutsu Kaisen's" anime adaptation was officially announced in an issue of Weekly Shonen Jump in 2019 (via Anime News Network) and was released in late 2020. Meanwhile, "Dorohedoro" received a similar announcement in 2018 but was not released until early 2020. With this in mind, we estimate that "Chainsaw Man" will see the light of day sometime within the next year or so.
<br>
    Luckily, if you can't bear to wait a single extra second for "Chainsaw Man," the first part of the manga has been completed for over half a year now. It's unknown how faithful the anime intends to be to its source material, but nowadays the industry standard is for adaptations to stick closely to their manga progenitors. So, it'll likely be the same story.

What is the plot of Chainsaw Man?

    While MAPPA has yet to announce a release date or cast for "Chainsaw Man," we don't need their seal of approval to clue you in on what you're bound to see when the anime finally debuts. The "Chainsaw Man" manga is roughly three years ahead of its animated counterpart, so there's plenty of plot to go around. Still, here are the basics.
<br>
   Set in an alternate version of the year 1997, where Devils (creatures manifested from human fears) are as commonplace as house pests, "Chainsaw Man" follows down-and-out high schooler Denji. Forced into doing work for the Yakuza in order to pay off his father's debts, Denji engages in low-tier devil hunting on behalf of the organization. His chainsaw devil/dog Pochita assists him.
<br>
   Things change, however, when Denji contracts a sudden case of death courtesy of his Yakuza buddies. In order to prevent this fate, Pochita signs a contract with his master. The two fuse into a devil-human hybrid and Denji becomes "Chainsaw Man." Now armed with a chainsaw in place of his hands and face, Denji continues to slay demons on behalf of the government's Public Safety Division. The following events are rife with horror, gore, and more than a little R-rated comedy, but it is sure to be a captivating ride for people who love their fiction imbued with flavors more than a bit of twisted surrealism.
